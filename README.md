# DataRepresentationLearning
The current code is located in /ImitationDuckie. The datasets are stored on rudolf on the sdb drive. To run hyperparameter optimization run ID_Bayesian_Optimizer.py. To run a network with default parameters run ID_Network_Graph.py.
The hyperparameters are exchanged between the optimizer and the invidual network as a ParameterBatch object which is defined in _utils/ID_utils.py.
